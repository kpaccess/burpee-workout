name: code-review
description: Comprehensive code review for TypeScript, NextJS, React, and MUI projects. Triggers whenever code changes are made (file saves, before commits, before pushes). Analyzes correctness, security, performance, style, and test coverage with detailed line-by-line feedback, risk assessment, and fix suggestions. Automatically checks for Firebase/database impacts by reviewing CLOUD.md files. Use this skill EVERY TIME you or the user adds new code, modifies existing code, or prepares to commit/push. Also use it on-demand when you want a thorough second opinion on code quality and safety.
compatibility: Requires access to file system and git information

## Overview

This skill provides **thorough, detailed code reviews** for TypeScript/NextJS/React/MUI projects. It analyzes changes comprehensively across multiple dimensions and flags potential issues before they reach production.

The skill serves two modes:

- **Automatic**: Triggered on file save, before commit, before push (when hooked up)
- **On-demand**: Invoke anytime you want a second opinion on code quality

## Review Dimensions

Each review covers these areas:

### 1. **Correctness & Logic**

- Type safety issues (missing types, incorrect generics)
- Logic errors and edge cases
- Null/undefined handling
- Dead code or unreachable paths
- Off-by-one errors, boundary conditions
- Incorrect async/await patterns

### 2. **Security**

- XSS vulnerabilities in React components → use DOMPurify, sanitize-html
- Injection attacks (SQL, command, template) → use parameterized queries, template escaping
- Insecure data handling (credentials, sensitive data in logs/DOM)
- Missing input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection gaps in forms
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Dependency vulnerabilities and outdated packages
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Unsafe deserialization
- Missing or weak CORS headers

### 3. **Performance**

- Unnecessary re-renders (missing React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- N+1 query patterns (loops with queries inside)
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) where O(n) exists)
- Large bundle additions without code splitting
- Memory leaks (event listeners, subscriptions not cleaned up)
- Unoptimized images or assets (no lazy loading, wrong formats)
- Missing code splitting opportunities
- Inefficient state updates (spread operator on large objects)
- Missing debounce/throttle on event handlers
- useEffect dependency array issues (missing deps, extra deps)

### 4. **Style & Conventions**

- Naming clarity and consistency
- File organization
- Component composition (prop drilling, abstraction levels)
- Code duplication (DRY principle)
- Linter rule compliance
- TypeScript best practices

### 5. **Testing**

- Missing test coverage for changed logic
- Insufficient test cases (edge cases, error paths)
- Brittle or flaky tests
- Test maintainability

### 6. **Database & Firebase**

- Breaking schema changes
- Migration safety
- Data consistency issues
- Firebase rules and security implications
- Backward compatibility with existing data

## How to Use

### Option A: Automatic Review (Hook-based)

For automatic triggering on file save, before commit, or before push, this requires hook configuration in your settings. See the _Setup_ section below.

### Option B: On-Demand Review

Ask Claude to review code in one of these ways:

**Review current working changes:**

```
Review my current code changes for quality, security, and correctness.
```

**Review staged changes:**

```
Review my staged changes before I commit.
```

**Review a specific file:**

```
Review web/src/components/UserForm.tsx for potential issues.
```

**Review commits before pushing:**

```
Review the commits I'm about to push to ensure they're safe.
```

**Review with Firebase context:**

```
Review these database changes and check if they're compatible with Firebase. Look at mobile/CLOUD.md and web/CLOUD.md for context.
```

## Review Process

When reviewing code, follow this workflow:

1. **Gather context**
   - Read the changed/new files
   - Check git diff to understand what changed
   - If Firebase changes detected, read `mobile/CLOUD.md` and `web/CLOUD.md`
   - Look for related tests or documentation

2. **Analyze each dimension** (see Review Dimensions above)
   - Flag issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Be aggressive: flag even "minor" issues if they don't follow best practices
   - Reference specific line numbers and code snippets
   - Explain the WHY behind each issue, don't just state the rule
   - Check against the anti-patterns list above

3. **Structure the report**

   **Executive Summary:**
   - Overall risk level (Safe / Low Risk / Medium Risk / High Risk / Critical)
   - Number of issues by severity
   - Key recommendations
   - Firebase/database impact (if applicable)

   **Detailed Findings** (organized by file and severity):

   ```
   ## [Filename]

   ### Critical Issues
   - **Line X-Y**: [Issue title]
     Issue: [Description]
     Impact: [What breaks/why this matters]
     Fix: [Specific suggestion with code example]

   ### High Issues
   - [Similar format]

   ### Medium Issues
   - [Similar format]

   ### Low Issues
   - [Similar format, praise positive patterns too]
   ```

   **Risk Assessment:**
   - Overall risk rating
   - Most critical issues
   - Database/Firebase implications
   - Recommended actions before merge/push

   **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Quick wins (easy fixes)
   - Refactoring opportunities
   - Testing recommendations
   - Performance optimization ideas

4. **Firebase/Database Handling**

   If you detect changes that might affect Firebase or database:

   a) **Ask first**: "I notice these changes might affect the database. Let me check the Firebase documentation."

   b) **Read context**: Try to load `mobile/CLOUD.md` and/or `web/CLOUD.md` to understand:
   - Current Firebase structure and schema
   - Security rules and access patterns
   - Data relationships and constraints
   - Existing field usage

   If files don't exist, suggest these best practices:
   - Document all collections and their fields
   - Document all security rules
   - Document data relationships
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for data models

   c) **Flag impacts**:
   - Breaking changes to existing data structure (removing/renaming fields)
   - Security rule violations or overly permissive access
   - Migration path issues (how will existing data be handled?)
   - Backward compatibility problems (old clients vs new data structure)
   - Missing indexes for queries (even if not causing errors yet)
   - Type mismatches between client code and Firestore data

   d) **Check for safety**:
   - Existing data won't break or require migration
   - Safe migration path documented
   - Tests cover database operations (integration tests with real Firestore)
   - Security rules properly restrict access
   - Error handling for missing/invalid data

   e) **Specific Firebase checks**:
   - `.where()` queries without indexes → flag as potential performance issue
   - `.delete()` without transaction/batch → flag if deleting related data
   - `.set()` with `merge: false` (overwrites) vs `merge: true` → flag intent
   - Missing `{ merge: true }` when updating partial data → likely bug
   - Firestore subcollections vs denormalization → suggest the right pattern
   - `useFirestoreQuery` or similar hook issues → flag missing error handling

## Common Anti-Patterns to Flag

Flag these patterns **aggressively**, even if they work:

**Type Safety Issues:**

- **`any` types anywhere** (instead of proper types) → High
- **`@ts-ignore` or `// @ts-nocheck`** → High
- **Missing type annotations** on function parameters or returns → Medium
- **Loose equality** (`==` instead of `===`) → Medium
- **Type assertions without validation** (`as Type` without runtime checks) → High

**React/NextJS Patterns:**

- **Direct DOM manipulation** (`document.getElementById`, `innerHTML`) → Medium/High
- **Mutable global state** (module-level let/var) → Medium
- **Props drilling** more than 2 levels deep → Medium
- **Large components** (300+ lines) → Medium
- **Missing error boundaries** → Medium
- **Synchronous loops in render** → High
- **Missing fallbacks** for optional chaining → Medium
- **Event listeners not cleaned up** → High
- **Callback re-creation on every render** (missing useCallback) → Medium
- **State in custom hooks without reset** → Medium
- **Missing dependency arrays** in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo → High
- **Overly complex useEffect** (should be split) → Medium

**Performance Red Flags:**

- **Inline object creation** in renders (`onClick={() => doThing()}`) → Medium
- **Inline array literals** (`dependencies: [arr]`) → Medium
- **useEffect with missing deps** (infinite loops) → High
- **Large useCallback/useMemo closures** → Medium
- **Map/filter creating new arrays on every render** → Medium

**API & Data:**

- **Unhandled promise rejections** → High
- **Missing `.catch()` on promises** → Medium
- **`async` without error handling** → Medium
- **Hardcoded API endpoints** instead of env vars → Medium
- **No loading/error states** for async operations → Medium

**General Code Quality:**

- **Console logs in production code** (except proper error logging) → Low
- **Magic numbers/strings** (hard-coded values) → Low
- **Functions with 3+ parameters** without object destructuring → Low
- **Hardcoded environment-specific values** → High
- **No input validation** at system boundaries → High
- **Dead code** (unused variables, functions) → Low
- **Comments instead of clear naming** → Low
- **Overly broad try-catch blocks** → Medium

## Severity Levels (Aggressive)

- **Critical**: Breaks functionality, security vulnerability, data loss, blocks merge, causes runtime errors
- **High**: Likely bug, significant security issue, performance regression, memory leak, type unsafety
- **Medium**: Code quality issue, suboptimal pattern, test gap, maintainability concern, minor performance issue
- **Low**: Style inconsistency, naming clarity, documentation gaps, code organization, minor improvements

## Key Principles

- **Be thorough**: Cover all review dimensions, not just syntax
- **Be specific**: Always reference line numbers and provide code examples
- **Explain the why**: Help the developer understand the reasoning, not just the rule
- **Offer solutions**: Don't just flag problems—suggest concrete fixes with code
- **Praise good patterns**: Highlight correct implementations and best practices
- **Check context**: Understand the PR/commit intent before reviewing
- **Respect constraints**: Note when issues are trade-offs rather than clear mistakes

## Setup (For Automatic Triggering)

To enable automatic code review on file save, before commit, or before push, hooks must be configured in your Claude Code settings. This requires your Claude Code administrator to add the appropriate hooks. Contact support or refer to the settings documentation.

## Examples

**Example 1: Security Issue**

````
### Critical Issues

- **Line 42**: Potential XSS vulnerability in component render
  Issue: User input is directly interpolated into JSX without sanitization
  ```tsx
  // ❌ Before
  return <div>{userData.bio}</div>

  // ✅ After
  return <div>{DOMPurify.sanitize(userData.bio)}</div>
````

Impact: Attackers could inject malicious scripts via user bio field
Fix: Use DOMPurify or similar library to sanitize user input before rendering

```

**Example 2: Performance Issue**
```

### High Issues

- **Line 18-25**: Unnecessary re-renders on every parent update
  Issue: useCallback dependency array missing, causing child components to re-render

  ```tsx
  // ❌ Before
  const handleClick = () => {
    /* ... */
  };

  // ✅ After
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    /* ... */
  }, [dependency]);
  ```

  Impact: Performance degradation in lists with many items
  Fix: Wrap handler in useCallback and specify correct dependencies

```

**Example 3: Database Impact**
```

### Critical Issues

- **database changes**: Removing 'accountStatus' field without migration
  Firebase Impact: Existing user documents have this field; clients expecting it will break
  Safety: UNSAFE - will cause runtime errors in existing app
  Fix:
  1. Add migration to set default value for legacy clients
  2. Update Firebase rules to handle missing field
  3. Deploy new version before removing field from database
     Reference: See mobile/CLOUD.md line 23 - accountStatus is required for user authentication

```

- `react-window` or `react-virtualized` — infinite lists
- `framer-motion` — performant animations

**Forms:**
- `react-hook-form` — lightweight form library
- `formik` — form state management

**Type Safety:**
- `typescript` strict mode everywhere
- `type-fest` — useful utility types

**Testing:**

**Code Quality:**
- `eslint` with strict rules
- `prettier` for formatting
- `husky` for git hooks

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Run early and often**: Review before committing, not just before pushing
2. **Include context**: Tell Claude what the change is trying to accomplish
3. **Act on feedback**: Treat critical and high issues as merge blockers
4. **Iterate**: Use the feedback to improve code quality over time
5. **Build incrementally**: Smaller changes are easier to review thoroughly
6. **Test before review**: Ensure basic functionality works, then seek detailed review
7. **Be aggressive**: Flag style issues, anti-patterns, and suboptimal code — not just bugs
